# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles.

## Project Structure

- `day_1.py`: Python script for Day 1 solution
- `day_2.py`: Python script for Day 2 solution
- `inputs/`: Folder containing input data files
  - `1.txt`: Input for Day 1
  - `2.txt`: Input for Day 2

## How to Run

To run a solution for a specific day:

1. Run the script directly: `python day_1.py` (for Day 1), `python day_2.py` (for Day 2), etc.

Make sure you have Python installed. The solutions are written in Python 3.

## Notes

- Input files are stored in the `inputs/` folder. Download them from the Advent of Code website after logging in.
- Scripts read from `inputs/X.txt` where X is the day number.

## Progress

- Day 1: Completed
- Day 2: Completed
- Day 3: Completed
- ...

Happy coding!
