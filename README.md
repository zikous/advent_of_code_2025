# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles.

## Project Structure

- `day_i.py`: Python script for Day i solution (for i=1,2,3,4,...)
- `inputs/`: Folder containing input data files
  - `i.txt`: Input for Day i (for i=1,2,3,4,...)

## How to Run

To run a solution for a specific day:

1. Run the script directly: `python day_1.py` (for Day 1), `python day_2.py` (for Day 2), etc.

Make sure you have Python installed. The solutions are written in Python 3.

## Notes

- Input files are stored in the `inputs/` folder. Download them from the Advent of Code website after logging in.
- Scripts read from `inputs/X.txt` where X is the day number.
